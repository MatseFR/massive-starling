This sample requires the [valeditor](https://github.com/MatseFR/valeditor) lib

This is a work in progress : you can already use it to save and load configurations but you can't import textures for now (if you want to do that you can extend or change the code)

My NumericDragger UI component (number with dots below) has a known bug where it'll sometimes react as if you clicked it, triggering text input : just click outside and it'll work again normally. I'll investigate that when I can.
